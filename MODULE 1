Problem Statement
1.Statement
Write a program that takes three numbers and prints their sum. Every number is given on a separate line.

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
print(a + b +c)

2.Write a program that greets the person by printing the word "Hi" and the name of the person. 

code:
name = input("Please enter your name: ")
print("Hi", name)

3.Write a program that takes a number and print its square.

 n = float(input())
print(n ** 2)

4.Write a program that reads the length of the base and the height of a right-angled triangle and prints the area. Every number is given on a separate line.

base = float(input())
height = float(input())
area = 0.5 * base * height
print(area)

5.Write a program that greets the user by printing the word "Hello", a comma, the name of the user and an exclamation mark after it
name = input()
print("Hello, " + name + "!")

6.N students take K apples and distribute them among each other evenly. The remaining (the undivisible) part remains in the basket. How many apples will each single student get? How many apples will remain in the basket?
The program reads the numbers N and K. It should print the two answers for the questions above.

N = int(input())  # Num of students
K = int(input())  # Num of apples

apples_per_student = K // N
remaining_apples = K % N

print(apples_per_student)
print(remaining_apples)
